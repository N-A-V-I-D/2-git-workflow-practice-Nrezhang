## My Takewaways

This article is written by someone who has walked the career path that I aspire to take in the future. The core ideas of the article are to prioritize learning and push yourself to do things out of your comfort zone, while still maintaining a balanced life.

This article gives me some comfort in the fact that working as a software engineer is a long term endeavor. Knowledge compounds over time, and is not overnight, so as long as I maintain a "strong learning mindset and being patient and disciplined."
